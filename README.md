`geomnet` is a package built on top of the most recent major `ggplot2` release. It provides a `ggplot2` `geom` called `geom_net` to visualize graphs and networks. It also include the function `stat_net` to calculate network layouts with the `sna` package. Finally, the function `geom_circle` is included to draw circles using `ggplot2`.

You can now install geomnet directly from CRAN.

`install.packages('geomnet')`

Enjoy!
