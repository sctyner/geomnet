# ggnet
If you're looking to install geom_net, use `install_github("sctyner/ggplot2")` in your R console. 

All the examples contain the `theme_net` object, which is in the example folder.  

You will need to have the `network` and `sna` packages loaded as well before doing the examples. 

All the data sets used in the examples are in the Data folder.  

Enjoy!
